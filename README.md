# mtb_suspension_analyzer

## Description

This is a prototype of a suspension analyzer system.

The prototype will be initially developed for a hardtail mtb. A prototype for full suspended mtb will probably be developed in the future with the help of some friends that own a full suspended mtb.

I will mainly code in Arduino language. 

At the moment the prototype will be developed using ESP8266 as MCU.

## Dev stages

1. Develop code and circuit diagram for the first version of the project: an easy Arduino data collector
2. Understand how to elaborate collected data
3. Write UML and LaTeX documentation for a more advanced version of the project
4. Continue...

## Used Hardware

- 2 x ESP8266
- 2 x LSM6DSOX
- 1 x TOF200C-VL53L0X
- 1 x SSD1306 OLED display (0.91", (128x32)px)
- 1 x micro sd storage expansion board
- 2 x 18650 batteries in parallel (main board)
- 1 x 18650 battery (secondary board)
