# mtb_suspension_analyzer

## Description

This is a prototype of a suspension analyzer system.

The prototype will be initially developed for a hardtail mtb, maybe a prototype for full suspended mtb will developed in the future with the help of some friends that own a full suspended mtb.

I will use micrpython as programming language since it is supposed to be easier and faster to implement than Arduino language. 

The first tests will be done with esp32 and the final version will be made with UDoo, which implements an esp3 and a raspberry pico cpu.

## Used Hardware

- 1 x UDoo
- 2 x IMU / MPU (what model?)
- 1 x TOF200C-VL53L0X
- 1 x SSD1306 OLED display (what size and format?)
- 1 x micro sd storage expansion board
- 2 x 18650 batteries in parallel
